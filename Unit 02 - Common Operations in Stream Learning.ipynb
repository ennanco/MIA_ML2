    "So, what is the problem with this approach?  In reality, it has no problem,  but there are some potential disadvantages, particularly with respect to data size, addition of new data, and heterogeneity of features over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset  size:   Given the example above, imagine if the data returned by `load_breast_cancer` was too large to fit into the memory of your computer.  In that case,  the program would have crashed. Although some techniques can be applied to minimize this threat, such as optimizing the typing, or the use of sparse data storage,  there is a limit to the optimizations available.   Indeed, if the dataset consisted of millions of samples (corresponding to hundreds of gigabytes), special hardware may have been required just to load the dataset. One solution is to perform out-of-core learning,  which  works on data chunks or mini-batches;  potentially giving rise to other downstream effects related to the data ordering and spurious local minima of each mini-batch when using optimization to obtain model weights.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Growing dataset:   Another potential issue is the incorporation of new data into the model. Traditional approaches require starting from scratch with a new dataset result of the combination of the old data with the new samples available. This is particularly problematic in real-time applications where you have new data available now and then. In many real applications, the solution is to perform a continuous integration pipeline which can deploy a new model nearly several times per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature heterogeneity:   Finally, another disadvantage with this traditional ML approach is the availability of the features across time and/or datasets from different sources. In particular,  some features might not be available at a particular moment in time, but later become available with a new measurement system.  Another example is in a warehouse.  Imagine that at a particular moment,  the state or amount of an item in stock in the warehouse is not available until a later time (a month later, for example)  when it is included in the dataset.

Remember that `dict` is implemented in **Python**, while the `numpy.array` is implemented at a low level in **C** and **Fortran**. One of the advantages of using `dict` is easy access to the features and a clearer program. \n",

    "# The incremental learning with decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Until this point we have focussed on ML techniques that can be implemented in a seamless way with incremental learning, such as the linear or logistic regression. However, there are other techniques that can be adapted to follow this approach, although they require more effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, decision Trees and their variants are an important family of ML techniques.  These methods have proven particularly useful and performant when used in conjunction with ensemble techniques  (bagging, boosting, etc.).  The often cited advantages of decision trees are their flexibility, versatility towards data, and simplicity to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless,  traditional decision tree algorithms require several iterations over the data, thereby rendering them unsuitable for incremental (stream) learning.   As such,  several candidate tree algorithms have emerged that address this issue and make them suitable for stream learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular adaptations is Hoeffding Trees (HT) due to their properties similar to batched approaches, such as (C4.5/J48, CART, M5, etc.):\n",
    "* Only require a single pass over the data\n",
    "* (Theoretical) guarantees the convergence with their batch counterpart with enough observations and a stationary data distribution\n",
    "* It can operate on scarce resources of memory and computation time.\n",
    "* Some of their variations can deal with non-stationary distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact,  with the recent spotlight on  Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),  these tree  techniques have taken on a special importance,  because they offer better interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the use of these tree algorithms,  we shall study a simple example where its use can be representative. For this,  we will use the same Restaurant dataset,  downloaded previously, however now analyzed with a single tree. \n"

    "1. To study incremental learning further, modify the above example that calculates the mean and variance to study data standardization with these methods: \n",
    "* To now calculate the running median and mode of the data. \n",
    "* Compare and contrast the results of the running median and mode to the running mean and variance, and observe how the different measures change as more data is added incrementally. \n",
    "* Explore other ways of normalizing the data, such as using the z-score or the min-max normalization method.\n",

    "* Write the code that will use another  loss function and optimizer available in River.    \n",
    "* Write the same code, but now wrapping the equivalent Scikit model.  How do the two compare?  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Trees and Incremental learning:  Modify the example above that uses the HoeffdingTreeRegressor.  To do this, experiment with different values for the grace_period parameter of the HoeffdingTreeRegressor.   The grace_period parameter controls the number of instances a leaf should observe between split attempts. Increasing the value of grace period will lead to fewer splits and thus a smaller tree.  In particular, try different values for grace_period (e.g. 50, 100, 250, 500) and see how it affects the size of the tree and the performance of the model. Write a code snippet that modifies the pipeline and runs the progressive evaluation. Evaluate the model using a evaluation metric of your choice.\n"
